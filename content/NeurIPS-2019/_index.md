<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://www.eventbrite.com/e/neurips-2019-remote-meetup-tickets-85103864951">Wednesday Night</a> <-----------> <a href="https://www.meetup.com/Huntsville-AI/events/266922878">Thursday Lunch</a></p>


Huntsville AI is delighted to announce that we will be participating as a remote meetup for the 2019 NeurIPS conference! This conference sold out in under 15 minutes in 2018, and in 2019 NeurIPS changed to a randomized lottery system for making tickets available to the public. In addition to the ticketing changes, NeurIPS is also making the content from the conference available to remote meetups for streaming and replay. Huntsville AI was selected as one of the remote meetups for 2019.

Our plan for the conference is to hold a 3 hour session for our usual Wednesday night meetup as part of CoWorking Night (6pm-9pm), followed by a 2 hour session over lunch (11am-1pm) on Thursday at Adtran (Fountainview Conference Room). For those with childcare needs, children are welcome at the Wednesday night session, and we are planning to provide vouchers for those that need help with childcare during the Thursday session. Our goal is to make this meetup available to anyone in the Huntsville area that would like to attend. If you need assistance with childcare for the Thursday session, please use the form at the bottom of this page to let us know.

We will be selecting various sessions & invited talks to stream and discuss during our meetup. The Thursday session at Adtran will be broken into 2 blocks for those that may need to leave or arrive in the middle of the session. Food & drinks will be provided for both events. Take a look at the list of sessions available and let us know which are of the most interest to you with [this form](https://forms.gle/A4WPXexA12HUnafx8).

The purpose of the Neural Information Processing Systems annual meeting is to foster the exchange of research on neural information processing systems in their biological, technological, mathematical, and theoretical aspects. The core focus is peer-reviewed novel research which is presented and discussed in the general session, along with invited talks by leaders in their field.

The conference had > 5,000 registered participants in 2016, > 7,000 in 2017, and 8,000 in 2018, making it the largest conference in Artificial Intelligence.
