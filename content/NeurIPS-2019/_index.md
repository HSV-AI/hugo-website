This year, the NeurIPS conference is making content available (and supporting) local meetups! You can find more information about how this works from the NeurIPS [Medium post](https://medium.com/@NeurIPSConf/announcing-neurips-meetups-44b2385c67a2)

Participants will be required to sign the NeurIPS [Code of Conduct](https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fneurips.cc%2Fpublic%2FCodeOfConduct&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNG4IxtOWwqqhAUR0qZLlPryD6j_Vg). 

As with all Huntsville AI events, everyone is welcome. Childcare will not be provided, but children are welcome.

Initially, we are thinking of holding the meetup during CoWorking Night on December 11, running from 6pm - 9pm. This will consist of streaming the pre-recorded key note sessions with a local discussion between. If you are interested in more than this, please let us know using the form below.

Stay tuned for other announcements and an EventBrite invitation for free tickets to this event.
