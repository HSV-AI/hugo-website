## Huntsville AI Remote NeurIPS Meetup

Huntsville AI is delighted to announce that we will again be participating as a remote meetup for the NeurIPS conference! This conference sold out in under 15 minutes in 2018, and in 2019 NeurIPS changed to a randomized lottery system for making tickets available to the public. In addition to the ticketing changes, NeurIPS began making the content from the conference available to remote meetups for streaming and replay. Huntsville AI was selected as one of the remote meetups for 2019 and again this year.

We are working out a plan for hosting several sessions virtually this year. Our goal is to make this meetup available to anyone in the Huntsville area that would like to attend. We will be selecting various sessions & invited talks to stream and discuss during our meetup. Please take a look at the list of sessions available and let us know which are of the most interest to you with [this form](https://forms.gle/A4WPXexA12HUnafx8).

The purpose of the Neural Information Processing Systems annual meeting is to foster the exchange of research on neural information processing systems in their biological, technological, mathematical, and theoretical aspects. The core focus is peer-reviewed novel research which is presented and discussed in the general session, along with invited talks by leaders in their field.

The conference had > 5,000 registered participants in 2016, > 7,000 in 2017, and 8,000 in 2018, making it the largest conference in Artificial Intelligence.
