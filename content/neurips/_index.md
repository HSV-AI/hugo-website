## Huntsville AI Remote NeurIPS Meetup

Huntsville AI is delighted to announce that we will again be participating as a remote meetup for the NeurIPS conference! This conference sold out in under 15 minutes in 2018, and in 2019 NeurIPS changed to a randomized lottery system for making tickets available to the public. In addition to the ticketing changes, NeurIPS began making the content from the conference available to remote meetups for streaming and replay. Huntsville AI was selected as one of the remote meetups for 2019 and again this year.

For the 2020 event, we will have 3 different sessions - covering 3 different types of NeurIPS sessions:

1. Tuesday 12/7/2020 6-7pm - [Selected Oral Talks](https://www.meetup.com/Huntsville-AI/events/275016858/)
2. Wednesday 12/8/2020 6-8pm - [NeurIPS Keynotes](https://www.meetup.com/Huntsville-AI/events/275017401/)
3. Thursday 12/9/2020 11am-2pm- [Deep Conversational AI Tutorial](https://www.meetup.com/Huntsville-AI/events/275017666/)

## More information on NeurIPS (Neural Information Processing Systems):

The purpose of the Neural Information Processing Systems annual meeting is to foster the exchange of research on neural information processing systems in their biological, technological, mathematical, and theoretical aspects. The core focus is peer-reviewed novel research which is presented and discussed in the general session, along with invited talks by leaders in their field.

The conference had > 5,000 registered participants in 2016, > 7,000 in 2017, and 8,000 in 2018, making it the largest conference in Artificial Intelligence.
