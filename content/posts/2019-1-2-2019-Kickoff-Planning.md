Let's get together and discuss what we want to do for 2019!

I would like to break the discussion into three areas:
1. Education - what do you want to learn?
2. Collaboration - what other groups can we work with in Huntsville?
3. Community - how can we give back to our local community?

## Education

Last year, we started working through the Fast.ai Deep Learning course. I think we made it through session 4, but stalled after that.
We have 3 sessions scheduled in January that will be education focused.

## Colaboration

There are two groups in Huntsville that I believe we have a lot of synergy with. 
The [Huntsville Python Users Group](https://www.meetup.com/hsv-py/) would be interested in a Python focused event. We may also be able
to expand the size of our group with HSV.py folks that are interested in AI.

The other group is the [North Alabama Cloud Computing](https://www.meetup.com/North-Alabama-Cloud-Computing/) group. We could do a joint
session with them to determine a good way to create some sort of group account for Hunstville AI with some sort of budget that may be
provided for with contributions. I would like for Huntsville AI to be able to provide compute resources during a session or workshop with
no cost and minimal setup required.

## Community

[Designers Corner Huntsville](https://www.facebook.com/designerscornerhsv/) - Maybe we can talk them into throwing together a logo that we can use.

[NASA Space Apps Challenge](https://www.spaceappshsv.com/) - Late October. We could put together a team to compete or provide technical
mentors for any AI related needs.

[Boys & Girls Club of North Alabama](https://bgcnal.com/) - Planning to present a session to high school kids to talk about opportunities
and challenges in the AI field.

[Hudson Alpha Tech Challenge](https://hudsonalpha.org/techchallenge/) - February 22-24 - The HudsonAlpha Tech Challenge is a unique
event to engage the development community and take on challenges in life sciences using business strategy, software development
and technology.

[AlphaPilot — Lockheed Martin AI Drone Racing Innovation Challenge](http://www.lockheedmartin.com/alphapilot) - Open Registration 
(November 2018 – February 2019), Virtual Qualifying Round (March 2019) - [Better Info](https://www.lockheedmartin.com/content/dam/lockheed-martin/eo/documents/Lockheed-Martin-AlphaPilot-FAQ-2018.pdf)


## Other Stuff

[Bug Analysis](https://github.com/HSV-AI/bug-analysis) - If there's enough time remaining, I will walk through my personal project and get some comments & ideas for improvement.
