# The Vision for HSV AI

I have been organizing an occasional meetup as part of [CoWorking Night](https://cwnflyer.com/) beginning in 2018. This group has been invigorating as a place to discuss our interest and interaction with Data Science, Artificial Intelligence, and Machine Learning. As a result, I started putting together my thoughts on what I would like for this group to grow into.

The best way that I could find to communicate those thoughts is with a Vision & Mission statement:

### Vision - What do we want to exist or be in the future?
Our vision is a group of individuals and organizations in the metro Huntsville area who collaboratively advance the knowledge and application of artificial intelligence in ways that make it available to everyone and improve our quality of life.

### Mission - What steps are we currently taken to achieve the vision?
  * Meetups & Socializing to connect and share knowledge
  * Learning Events to educate and promote AI and its application
  * Sponsored "AI Lab" sessions to make cloud computing accessible to everyone that wants to participate
  * Competitions to apply AI to solve problems

This group currently has a home on Facebook for those in the Huntsville, AL area that want to join up:
