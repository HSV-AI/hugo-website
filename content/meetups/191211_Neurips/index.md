Huntsville AI was selected to host a remote NeurIPS meetup to coincide with the global NeurIPS conference in Vancouer Canada. The remote meetup consisted of a Wednesday night 3 hour session to close out Huntsville AI for 2019 and another 2 hour session held at Adtran on Thursday.

Both sessions were well attended, and a lot of good conversations and connections were made!

Overall, it was the best event of the year! We could not have done it without the help of Chuck, who provided the graphics and AV for both sessions. 

## Here's to more of this in 2020!
