We had a pretty large group in attendance as we kicked off the 2020 year in Huntsville AI.

We discussed items and themes that we want to cover in the first half of 2020, and many that may run throughout the year. You can find a categorized list of topics below.

## Other Discussion

We talked a bit about holding meetups during the week in conjuction with our normal Wednesday night meetup. Hopefully this would help us reach those that may not know about Huntsville AI or CoWorking Night.

We discussed the administrative work needed to schedule events every week. Possibly we can create something that automatically duplates traffic between our multiple channels:

* Facebook Group
* LinkedIn Group
* Meetup
* hsv-ai.com
* Google Group
