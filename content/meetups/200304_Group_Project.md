For 3 weeks, we got together and discussed a group project. The intent is to take the output of our Fast.ai lesson 1 model and make it available through a variety of web platforms. Hopefully we will learn how to deploy an image classification model.

We didn't get much further than discussions of how to implement the project and containerization with Docker. There is an initial repo in Github for this, but no further action at this time.
